Mr Donald Baidwyn noted that the park area which was land deemed for recreational use when the developer was given permission to develop the Orchard Circuit/Dunstan Court Estate as part of the planning for that estate, was undeveloped. He called on local residents in the area for their support and organised contact with local councillors to meet with residents at a park BBQ held on the site, which was met with a very positive response. Mr Baldwyn had plans drawn up for submission to council for their approval. The plans were adapted for what the park is now. He collected donations from residents for the purchase of trees/shrubs for the area in addition to what council gave so that the area would be well covered around the outer boundaries. Once these trees were purchased, and the land semi developed by council, he organised a working bee for the planting of these trees and shrubs. He also developed a roster for the watering and care of these plants to assist in their early establishment. To this day, he still tends to the park, inspecting the plants for care and the grassed area to see if it needs watering. The park is much used by families as an area to fly kites, kick the footy, play soccer and football, and is also used by some elderly as a walking area, where they may take a seat when they tire, or to just watch the world go by in a peaceful environment, thanks to his foresight in developing this area.",,

She had continued this work on her return to England, and had encouraged poor people, especially young women, to leave the squalor of their homeland and emigrate to Australia. Her work in Victoria was in providing clean, cheap and safe accommodation to families or single people on the way to the Mount Alexander diggings.

The parish of Darlingford was originally on the south side of the Goulburn River on both sides of the Big River; it included a thin strip of land south of the Goulburn River between the confluences with the Goulburn of Jerusalem Creek and the Delatite River. The town (surveyed 1864) was on the Big River very near its junction with the Goulburn River, near the present Darlingford Reach and Darlingford Point (Point Knight). Named after Sir Charles (Henry) Darling (1809-70), governor of Victoria (1863-66). Darling is the Old English deorling, which had the same meaning a thousand years ago as now. The town was also known in its early days as The Junction or Big River Junction. Darlingford and Enoch's Point (q.v.) sprang up as a result of the discovery of gold on the Big River in 1854. There were schools at Darlingford from the 1860s, but there was also a Darlingford State School at Peachey's Bridge (q.v.). Darlingford township was submerged (ca. 1927), with much of the parish, by the filling of the Sugarloaf Reservoir, but see also New Darlingford. Spreadborough & Anderson's maps show a Darlingford pastoral run, but neither they nor Billis & Kenyon mention it in the text. The Borothat run, to the west of Darlingford on the map, looks too small. The Darlingford run may well be a mapping error for part of the Borothat run.",,

During September and early October the Allies steadily drove the Germans back to the top of Passchendaele ridge. Through October and into November, wet weather and sheer exhaustion meant further attacks became hopelessly bogged down. Though the final ridge was eventually gained, no breakthrough was possible. Losses were horrendous on both sides. Official War Historian Charles Bean wrote: I have often thought that many a youngster when he was hit out there on the Passchendaele heights ... and he knew that the end had come - must have thought to himself: ""well at least they'll remember me in Australia.""

George Gordon McCrae reminisced that 'Bunting and great wicker balls' told what type of vessel was approaching and the port of origin. Marryat's code of signal flags was used to carry news from Williamstown. The advent of the telegraph rendered the flagstaff redundant and operation ceased on 1 October 1857. The signaller's store and dwelling were incorporated into the Flagstaff Observatory. At 130 ft (39.6 m) in height, and with better sight lines of Williams-town and the bay, Flagstaff Hill had been preferred to Batmans Hill as the observatory site. The Flagstaff Gardens were planted on the site in the 1860s.",http://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM00580b.htm,
MELBOURNE CITY,FLAGSTAFF GARDENS,PARK,PARK,144.9544344,-37.8104557,"Flagstaff Gardens is the oldest park in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, first established in 1862. In 2005 it is one of the most visited and widely used parks in the city by nearby office workers and tourists. The gardens are notable for their archaeological, horticultural, historical and social significance to the history of Melbourne. The gardens are 7.2 hectares (18 acres) of Crown Land bounded by William, La Trobe, King and Dudley streets, managed by the City of Melbourne. On the south-east corner opposite is the entrance to Flagstaff railway station. Diagonally opposite stands the Victorian branch of the Royal Mint, established 7 August 1869. The former Royal Mint building is a well-preserved example of Victorian Gold Rush boom-period classical styled architecture. The facade features paired columns with scrolled capitals and the Royal Mint coat-of-arms. On the northeast corner over William Street, is the Queen Victoria Market. The park contains extensive lawns with a variety of mature trees, flowerbeds and wild animals including possums. The southern end is characterised by deciduous trees, while the northern end contains mature eucalypts. Avenues of elms shade pathways along with several large Moreton Bay Fig trees. The north corner contains a bowling lawn, rose beds, flower and shrub beds. Along William Street there are tennis courts, which also double as volleyball, handball and netball courts. Electric barbecues nearby provides a popular site for office parties in December. Scattered about the lawns and gardens are memorials and sculptures that illuminate some of the social significance of the area. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff_Gardens",,

When he died in 1860, 'Prince Albert' his son, sought to have this land transferred to his possession. However, given the urban expansion of Camperdown, the grant was cancelled, and another reserve in the worse accessible locality near Camperdown was proposed. The Framlingham mission station was established near Warrnambool in 1865 and this station became the home of many of the surviving Djargurd wurrung. A number of old people, however, refused to abandon their traditional country. By 1877, there were only two aged Djargurd wurrung men living in the Camperdown district. They lived near a brewery and were well cared for by local town residents, but would not go to Framlingham. ",,

He was born at Ballarat in Victoria on 18 September 1889 and became a teacher. Joining the AIF in September 1914 as a lieutenant, Morshead was posted to the 2nd Battalion. 

By the time he landed at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915 he was a captain; by August, when he fought at Lone Pine, he had been promoted to major. After Gallipoli he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and given command of the 33rd Battalion, which arrived in France in November 1916. Morshead led the battalion successfully through Messines and the Passchendaele campaign of late-1917, was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, and continued to command through the battles Villers-Bretonneux and Amiens in 1918. 

Morshead joined General Monash's staff for the demobilisation of the AIF and returned to Sydney in December 1919. He married Myrtle Woodside in November 1921. Having failed to make a success of a soldier-settlers' block in Queensland, Morshead returned to Sydney to work in shipping, gaining promotions and posts in several Australian cities and in England. 

He remained active in the militia, commanding two battalions and reaching the rank of temporary brigadier. In October 1939 he was given command of the 18th Brigade, sailing for Britain in May 1940. The following February Morshead was promoted to major general in command of the 9th Division, then in the Middle East. Reputed to be a tough commander who could be blunt with senior officers, Morshead led his division through the siege of Tobruk where his aggressive defence denied the Germans a breakthrough but earned him the ire of some subordinates concerned at the level of losses. 

His success at Tobruk was followed by promotion to lieutenant general and command of the AIF in the Middle East. Morshead, at the risk of alienating his British superiors, argued to keep the 9th Division together in the face of British demands to detach individual brigades. He led the division through the battle of El Alamein, where the 9th Division's contribution was considered vital to the victory. During the battle, he regularly visited both the front and the wounded behind the lines. 

Returning to Australia in 1943, Morshead took command of II Corps in October and then in November was elevated to command both New Guinea Force and the Second Australian Army. In May 1944 he was given command of I Corps, leading them through the final battles of the war in Borneo. After the war, he chaired a military court of enquiry into Major General Bennett's departure from Singapore in February 1942. 

Morshead refused offers of military and diplomatic posts, as well as the governorship of Queensland, returning instead to the shipping industry as manager of the New South Wales branch of the Orient Line; later he became its Australian general manager. He held a number of other directorships and civil appointments and was involved in right-wing politics before becoming ill with cancer in the mid-1950s. Morshead died in Sydney on 26 September 1959.",https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/P10676535,

KINGSTON CITY,HAROLD CATERSON RESERVE,PARK,PARK,145.069634,-37.9506251,"Harold Caterson was a member of Moorabbin Rugby Union Football Club's first committee, he was at the initial meeting in December 1964 that agreed to create a rugby club in Moorabbin to commence in season 1965. He was a long-term committee member (in various positions) and club member in the 60s, 70s and 80s and he was key in establishing a home for Moorabbin at Keys. Rd. Additionally, he was involved on the Management Committee of the Victorian Rugby Union over many years.
In the history of the club Harold Caterson and Jack McDavitt stand out as the two most influential club members who founded, developed and built Moorabbin Rugby Club from scratch.
Jack has, appropriately, had the extended clubrooms (originally built in 1978) named in his honour for his contribution to the club. The reserve was renamed in honour of Harold's contribution to the club.

Keys Rd ground was an old rubbish tip that had been filled and covered in a layer of soil. The surface was continually subsiding, in 1965 junior cricket was played on this ground and the oval was found unsuitable for cricket; it was actually a muddy paddock in winter and a corrugated concrete oval in summer. Cricket never returned to this oval.
Harold could see the potential in the Keys Rd Reserve and in 1967 donated the cost of a single car steel garage placed on a concrete slab, which was to become our first changing room/clubroom, and was later known as ""the old tin shed"". It had the nickname of ""Mr. Cat's Cottage"" on a sign above the door.
The following year a small extension was added that held a briquette hot water service and several showers.
As the Club grew over the years, Harold continued to be a committee member and also continued to liaise with Council regarding club matters. Whether it was gaining approval for further extensions to the shed (there were several extensions over the years), ground improvements, a second playing field, flood lighting and eventually Clubrooms were built in 1978.
Harold was the ""go to person"" in regard to Council. He developed a very good relationship with Mayor Bricker, who later became our Patron for many years and over time became one of the Rams strongest supporters.
Gaining significant funding for a sport that was practically unknown in the district, was not easy. The relationship between Harold and Cr. Bricker proved vital on several occasions as the councillor supported funding for the club which otherwise might not have been approved.
That the Rams are based at Keys Road can be put down to Harold's dedication to securing a permanent home for rugby union in Moorabbin.

The club's playing jersey is also a legacy from Harold Caterson's U18 Marlins team.
He was President in 1968 and 1971; Vice President in 1969, 1970 and from 1972 to 1981 inclusive. Ordinary Committee Member 1965 to 1967.
Harold was made a Life Member in 1977.
Additionally, he was the Moorabbin club delegate to the Victorian Rugby Union for many years; and he would collate the results and statistics for the VRU weekly magazine each week during the season.
His work with the club, Council and the VRU continued right up to his sudden death in 1981.
It is worth noting that four generations of the Caterson family have been involved in playing and administrating the Moorabbin Rugby Club since its inception in 1965.",,

LODDON SHIRE,JACKA PARK,PARK,PARK,143.613071,-36.4179822,"Albert Jacka was born on 10 January 1893 at Layard near Winchelsea, Victoria, fourth child of Nathaniel Jacka and his wife Elizabeth, nÃ¿Â¿Ã¿Â©e Kettle. The family moved to Wedderburn when Albert was 5. After elementary schooling, Bert worked for the Victorian State Forests Department. 
Jacka enlisted in September 1914 as a private in the 14th Battalion, Australian Imperial Force. His unit spent two months training in Egypt before landing at Anzac Cove on 26 April 1915. On 19 May the Turks launched a massive counter-attack. Amid frenzied fighting at Courtney's Post some Turks captured a 11m section of trench, one end of which was guarded by Jacka. For several minutes he fired warning shots into the trench wall until reinforcements arrived and, after shouting his instructions, he and three others sprang out into the trench. All but Jacka were immediately hit so he leapt back into the communication trench. Two bombs were lobbed at the Turks while Jacka skirted around to attack from the flank. Amid the smoke and the noise he clambered over the parapet, shot five Turks and bayoneted two as the rest hastily retreated. For this action he received the Victoria Cross, the first to be awarded to the A.I.F. in the war.
Jacka became a national hero. He rose quickly through the ranks, passing officer training and was commissioned 2nd lieutenant in April 1916.
Jacka's platoon moved into the line near PoziÃ¿Â¿Ã¿Â¨res, France, on the night of 6-7 August 1916. German troops overran a part of the line at dawn. Jacka had just completed a reconnaissance and had gone to his dug-out when two Germans appeared at its entrance and rolled a bomb down the doorway, killing two men. Jacka charged up the dug-out steps, firing as he moved, and came upon a large number of the enemy rounding up some forty Australians as prisoners. He rallied his platoon and charged at the enemy, some of whom immediately threw down their rifles. Furious hand-to-hand fighting erupted as the prisoners turned on their captors. Fifty Germans were captured and the line was retaken. Jacka was awarded a Military Cross. The entire platoon was wounded, Jacka seriously in the neck and shoulder. He received further promotions. 
On 8 April 1917 Jacka led a night reconnaissance party into no man's land near Bullecourt to inspect enemy defences before an attack against the new German line. He penetrated the wire at two places, reported back, then went out again to supervise the laying of tapes to guide the infantry. The work was virtually finished when two Germans loomed up. Realizing that they would see the tapes, Jacka knew that they must be captured. He pulled his pistol; it misfired, so he rushed on and captured them by hand.For  this action he was awarded a Bar to his Military Cross.
He was wounded by a sniper's bullet near Ploegsteert Wood on 8 July. In May 1918 he was badly gassed at Villers-Bretonneux and saw no more action. In September 1919 he embarked for Australia where a large crowd, met him. He was demobilized in January 1920. Shortly after his return he formed an import export business with two former comrades. 
On 17 January 1921 Jacka had married Frances Veronica Carey, a typist from his office. They settled at St Kilda and later adopted a daughter. In September 1929 Jacka was elected to the St Kilda Council and became mayor a year later. He devoted most of his energies on council to assisting the unemployed. His own business flourished until 1929 when the Scullin government increased import tariffs and the company went into voluntary liquidation in September 1930. Jacka then became a commercial traveller with the Anglo-Dominion Soap Co.
He died on 17 January 1932. Nearly 6000 people filed past his coffin when it lay in state in Anzac House. The funeral procession, led by over 1000 returned soldiers flanked by thousands of onlookers, made its way to St Kilda cemetery where he was buried with full military honours.",http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/jacka-albert-6808,

The Mack's Creek settlement was surveyed and renamed Kevington, after the village in Kent, but failed to prosper, and the name Kevington was readopted by the township on the main road.

SWAN HILL RURAL CITY,LAKE BOGA,LAKE,LAKE,143.6458649,-35.4493819,"At one time, long years ago, there was a very large redgum tree growing in the lake, and its branches supported a tremendously large nest, the property of an immensely large pair of wedge-tailed eagles (Nurrayil'). One fine day a young mother wandered carrying her baby, a long way round the lake, and far from the camp, when, feeling tired, she sat down and amusedly watched her baby playing in the warm sand, when suddenly, and without warning, the larger of the two eagles swooped down and, seizing the baby, carrying it away over the water to its eyrie in the red gum tree. The poor mother, seeing her baby suddenly lost to her for ever, commenced a mournful wailing, which the curlews or stone plovers ('Will') in sympathy took up, and have continued ever since. The disconsolate young mother then hurried back to the camp and reported the occurrence, upon which the doctor or medicine-man ('Barngnull') directed that every person with a canoe was to proceed to the tree, and after cutting it down to tear it into little pieces, and to boat it all away to the river, where it was to be thrown upon the water to be carried away. The doctor then decreed that no more trees should grow in Lake Boga. The tree is falling hollowed out with its branches a big depression near the river, which they called 'Geranyuk' (where the branches and leaves fell). The large gnarled lump on the tree trunk struck and hollowed out a big hole at the entrance to the lake, which they named 'Wherpook' (where butt fell). (Stone 1911: 461).",,

He was in the habit of traversing the Mallee by the Pine Plains - Kulkyne Track when one place or the other got too hot for him. He was eventually shot in 1865m at Peechelba.' Massola says it is more likely the horse is named after the lake, and that the name comes from local Aboriginal mythology in which two brothers Bram-bram-bult are involved. The dam in the bed of the lake was excavated in 1962. The lake filled in 1976 causing seedling regeneration of River Red-gum along the high water mark. ",,

He was in the habit of traversing the Mallee by the Pine Plains - Kulkyne Track when one place or the other got too hot for him. He was eventually shot in 1865m at Peechelba.' Massola says it is more likely the horse is named after the lake, and that the name comes from local Aboriginal mythology in which two brothers Bram-bram-bult are involved. The dam in the bed of the lake was excavated in 1962. The lake filled in 1976 causing seedling regeneration of River Red-gum along the high water mark. ",,

Beolite was proposed but not adopted. Rail services arrived in October 1891, and finally ceased in November 1978. The railway station is now a visitors' information centre. The shire of Mansfield, first created in 1866, was incorporated into the shire of Delatite in 1994 but re-established in 2002.",,

A number of ""suburbs"" or satellite settlements sprang up, including Alhambra (q.v.), Harper's Creek, Mutton Town* and Toorak (after the Melbourne suburb; Woiworung or Bunurong Turrak*: reedy swamp, reedy grass, or weed in lagoon). Toorak was soon renamed Thackeray (after writer William Makepeace Thackeray). A bushfire in 1873 wiped out almost all the buildings and, as the road to Woods Point had been rerouted away from the hill, Matlock was rebuilt at the new crossroads on the site of the former Thackeray. The old site became or was renamed Matlock Hill (q.v.). Just south of Matlock are the headwaters of B.B. Creek* which (further down) had its own goldfield and settlement. (B.B. probably stands for Bare Buttocks, as the creek's vegetation was reputedly very rough on miners' clothing.) See also The Springs.",,

Also called Jones's Station after Stephen Jones (licensee, 1856-60?). All or part of this land became the second and possibly third sites of the Acheron Aboriginal Station (q.v.), and thereafter was sometimes also called the Blacks' Station. Kenyon's map shows the Mohican run too far north, and makes the adjoining Taggerty run too small. Spreadborough & Anderson's maps show the Mohican run correctly (perhaps extending a bit too far south). Mohican persists as a parish name and in the Mohican Plantation. Les Blake thinks the name was probably taken from James Fennimore Cooper's novel, The Last of the Mohicans (1826); if so, the word is a variant of the North American tribal name Mohegan (Algonquian maingan, wolf), a subgroup of the Pequot, and probably their relatives the Mahican (Muh-he-con-ne-ok, people of waters that are never still) (Waldman).

Their input went above and beyond the normal assistance offered by other community members and volunteers. Both Alec and Pat are the only life members of the Junior Football Club (of which the reserve is home to), and they have been heavily involved in all community groups over their respective lives. Pat had also been the local kindergarten assistant for over 30 years, and they were both well known and adored in the community. The couple bequeathed a large amount of money to all of these groups. The name change is in their honour as thanks for all of their generosity. ",,

The Niagaroon run probably extended further south than is shown in Spreadborough & Anderson's maps. Les Blake has suggested that Niagaroon may allude to Niagara Creek (see under Snobs Creek) to the east, but it is in fact an Anglicised form of the Taungurong Nyaggeron (or Ageroon), probably adopted by the first licensees Ouseley Cockburn and Dr. Dougald Fletcher, who also (according to Les Blake) named the Acheron River (q.v.).

MORELAND CITY,PENTRIDGE GAOL,HISI,HISTORIC SITE,144.9698611,-37.7381944,"Pentridge Prison was established in 1851 as a result of increased pressure on the Penal system due to the gold rush and the need for a place to hold those convicted of serious offences. The first stage was the 1850-1857 Pentridge Stockade Complex, a relatively ad-hoc group of structures built by prison labour and using predominantly local materials. The second phase undertaken in the late 1850s and early 1860s was the construction of Inspector General William Champ's model prison complex, based on British exemplars and incorporating a relatively sophisticated system of prisoner classification and penal reform. The main structures constructed at this stage and still surviving are the Entrance Building, Warder's residences, Prison Hospital, Panopticon B Division, F Division, a Workshop building (now known as the Laundry) and most of the prison walls. These were all constructed of bluestone. The prison was gradually expanded and developed in stages, reflecting both developments in penology as well as broader Government policies relating to the operation of the prison system. Following the Stawell Royal Commission of 1870 an extensive work program for prisoners was introduced as part of the system at Pentridge and a complex known as the Industries was constructed. These included a timber yard, a woollen mill, carpenters' and blacksmiths' workshops completed in 1879 and tailors' and bootmakers' workshops completed in 1886. A female prison was constructed on the site between 1860 and 1865 which is now known as A Division. This was superseded when a new female prison was constructed on the site between 1887 and 1894 in order to provide completely separate accommodation for women. This section is now known as D Division. Pentridge remained the main female prison until it was replaced by the new women's prison, HM Prison Fairlea in 1956. Pentridge was also the location of reformatories for both girls and boys, established following the findings of the Stawell Royal Commission of 1870. The Jika Reformatory for Boys was accommodated in an existing building (F Division), between 1875 and 1879, while a purpose built reformatory was constructed for the Jika Reformatory for Protestant Girls (G Division), which operated between 1875 and 1893. In 1900 labour yards for A Division were completed. During the 1950s these yards were later converted to a high security block which became known as H Division. In 1924 Pentridge replaced the Melbourne Gaol as the main remand and reception prison for the metropolitan area. The bodies of a number of prisoners executed at the Melbourne Gaol were exhumed and relocated to Pentridge, where they were reburied, possibly just east of D Division. Pentridge also became the venue for all subsequent hangings, until the last Victorian prisoner to suffer the death penalty, Ronald Ryan was executed in D Division in 1967. In April 1995 the Office of Corrections ordered that the six main towers at Pentridge be closed, since most of the high security prisoners from the gaol had been relocated to Barwon as part of the downgrading of Pentridge to a medium security prison. The prison was finally closed in 1996.",vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/306,

He did this on a voluntary basis for nearly 30 years using his own time, machinery and fuel.
<br>

Between 1916 and 1918 he served on the Western Front, experiencing all the horrors and heroism of those campaigns. He was a veteran of Pozieres, Bullecourt, Passchendaele, Ypres and Delville Wood. In 1918 he returned home to Lilydale, married, had a family and took up a business running a drapers store in Lilydale's Main Street. He also did community work and achieved an extraordinary amount for that township. His family believed his way of coping with what he saw during the war years was to keep himself busy with community work. He was awarded the MBE for his efforts for that community.

<br>1741 the Ranelagh Gardens were opened to the public.  Ranelagh became a fashionable holiday resort and was the model for the development of the Mount Eliza Ranelagh in 1924.  A number of Mount Eliza Ranelagh streets were named after London places.  More specifically, the Mount Eliza Ranelagh was promoted as an area where people could build their holiday homes with recreational facilities, parks and internal reserves and a community focus.  This approach was given full expression by Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Griffin who, consistent with their environmental and philosophical ideals, produced the 1924 plan.
<br>
<br>The Estate's historical significance has associations with Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin, leading figures in 20th century architectural and planning history and Saxil Tuxen who was an important town planning figure in Melbourne;",,

Upon reviewing the Map Source provided, along with the Place Names Committee (PNC) file index, the sources listed do not display the name Rawbottom Gully. The watercourse on a number of maps is unnamed.

Additional research undertaken by the Registered Planner, OGN and a local historical society found no reason why the name should exist in its current location. Research also found an alternative name, that being Rowbottom Gully, possible located further to the west. All correspondence and attachments have been printed and added to OGN file FOL/14/62172.  The original record was supposedly taken from a paper map in 1966. The date corresponds with other records which the PNC added to a register in 1966.

Based on the research and conversations between the Registered Planner, OGN and the Registrar of Geographic Names the record was un-linked from the Vicmap extent and the feature type was changed to Historic Site.",,Office of Geographic Names

Upon reviewing the Map Source provided, along with the Place Names Committee (PNC) file index, the sources listed do not display the name Rawbottom Gully. The watercourse on a number of maps is unnamed.

Additional research undertaken by the Registered Planner, OGN and a local historical society found no reason why the name should exist in its current location. Research also found an alternative name, that being Rowbottom Gully, possible located further to the west. All correspondence and attachments have been printed and added to OGN file FOL/14/62172.  The original record was supposedly taken from a paper map in 1966. The date corresponds with other records which the PNC added to a register in 1966.

<br>
<br>The Shaw family (Benjamin and Elizabeth) arrived in Dromana in 1875 and established Kangerong Guest House.  Their son Archibald Shaw married Maud McKeown, daughter of James and Catherine McKeown, and started the family connection.  Archibald was elected President of the Flinders Shire Council in 1924. Archibald and Maud raised and educated five children in Dromana (Maurice, Ernest, Archibald, Elizabeth and John).  Maurice was the long-term proprietor of the Shell Service Station in Dromana and Shaw's Motors on Nepean Highway for many years prior to his death in 1991 aged 87.  
<br>
<br>The McKeown family (James and Catherine) arrived in Dromana in 1864.  James cut timber for the Dromana pier in 1874 and in 1889 bought Gracefield and land to the East, where they planted an apple orchard.  That land covered the area on which the reserve is now located.  From 1889 to 1891 they were caretakers at Heronswood and in 1892 the McKeowns built Aringa Guest House (Cnr of Clarendon and Foote Streets Dromana) which was managed by their daughters for over 70 years until after the Second World War. James and Catherine raised 12 children (five sons and seven daughters); one daughter, Edith, the source for the naming of Edith Place, died in Dromana in 1987 aged 100. Two further generations of the Shaw and McKeown families have since lived in Dromana.
<br>
<br>The surrounding land and the land on which the reserve is located was subdivided by the descendants of the pioneering Shaws and McKeowns in 1977 and the reserve was transferred to the Shire of Flinders (and since Mornington Peninsula Shire) for use as public open space.",,

It embodies the devastating impact of that war on the Australian nation, and Victoria in particular, which lost the largest proportion of its young men in the country. When the project was conceived, Melbourne was the capital of Australia and the seat of Federal Parliament and this resulted in the grandest war memorial in Australia, until the Australian War Memorial was built in Canberra in 1941. Since World War II (1939-45) numerous elements, including a commemorative forecourt, trees, statues and memorials, have been added to the Shrine Reserve to honour servicemen and women and peacekeepers from 1939 to the present day. As the largest and most important war memorial in Victoria, it reflects the community's ongoing need for a public expression of grief and of commemoration for the sacrifice of life in war.",vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/806,

In 1943, American soldiers from the Pacific region used the land as a recreation camp. Towards the end of the Second World War the site was used as a P.O.W camp including Italian prisoners. The nickname 'Starlight' originated because of Mr Baker's tendency to roam the land at night. He may have used his property for hunting because in those days it was virgin bushland and very isolated.

Burial place of Baalwick, head of the Yeerun-illam-balluk band of the Taungurong; for many years the home of Scottish-born John Bon (1805-68) and his wife Ann, who gave the Taungurong people sanctuary here until they were resettled at Coranderrk (q.v.). Wappang was a Taungurong name probably for the Delatite River (""that part of the Devil's [sic] River on which the run was formed"" - Noble). Clark & Heydon (D) suggest that Yallermeerrangan (Yallermeourung), mentioned in George Augustus Robinson's journal (1840) was the Taungurong name for the Wappan area.

- Uncle Bryon Powell, Wadawurrung elder, shared a story on the 'soak' located on the site, the importance of that to cultural practices and being a place where clans would have gathered for food.

State school Yea No. 699 was in Yea, but Yea No. 1433 (eventually renamed Homewood) was at Gill's Gully and Mount Charlotte. Yea was originally called Muddy Creek after the nearby river; surveyed 1855-56 by Thomas Wilkinson Pinniger (commemorative cairn and plaque in High Street; see also Mount Pinniger); renamed (1855) after Colonel Lacy Walter Giles Yea (1808-55) commander of the 7th Royal Fusiliers, who served with General Windham in the Crimean War and was fatally wounded at Redan near Sebastopol. (The surname rhymed with saw, the place-name now rhymes with say.) Harvey Blanks reckons the name change was proposed by surveyor-general Sir Andrew Clarke (1824 - 1902) and implemented after surveyor Pinniger had discussed it with William Leyden Ker and Anna Maria Ker of the Killingworth pastoral run. (See also ""Antiquarian"", Alexandra Times, 23 June 1868.) The new name was ironically appropriate as Yea - a variant of the Devon and Somerset surname Yeo - comes from the Old English ea, stream, river. See also Marshmallow Hill, Providence Bridge, Sebastopol Creek, Windham and Yea River.",,
