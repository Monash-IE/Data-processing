The Camp has been highly praised for its country club character, with its own sewerage system, hot water and electricity, reticulated fresh water and a open air cinema. Lord Somers had a remarkable career with a highly developed sense of duty and leadership. Career highlights included his distinguished World War 1 service, Governor of Victoria  from 1926 to 1931, grand master of the United Grand Lodge of Victoria and his long term involvement with the scout movement as the Victorian chief commissioner in 1932 and as chief scout for Great Britain in 1941.",
