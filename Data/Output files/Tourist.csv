Historic Site,Moreland City,Pentridge Gaol,144.9698611,-37.7381944,"Pentridge Prison was established in 1851 as a result of increased pressure on the Penal system due to the gold rush and the need for a place to hold those convicted of serious offences. The first stage was the 1850-1857 Pentridge Stockade Complex, a relatively ad-hoc group of structures built by prison labour and using predominantly local materials. The second phase undertaken in the late 1850s and early 1860s was the construction of Inspector General William Champ's model prison complex, based on British exemplars and incorporating a relatively sophisticated system of prisoner classification and penal reform. The main structures constructed at this stage and still surviving are the Entrance Building, Warder's residences, Prison Hospital, Panopticon B Division, F Division, a Workshop building (now known as the Laundry) and most of the prison walls. These were all constructed of bluestone. The prison was gradually expanded and developed in stages, reflecting both developments in penology as well as broader Government policies relating to the operation of the prison system. Following the Stawell Royal Commission of 1870 an extensive work program for prisoners was introduced as part of the system at Pentridge and a complex known as the Industries was constructed. These included a timber yard, a woollen mill, carpenters' and blacksmiths' workshops completed in 1879 and tailors' and bootmakers' workshops completed in 1886. A female prison was constructed on the site between 1860 and 1865 which is now known as A Division. This was superseded when a new female prison was constructed on the site between 1887 and 1894 in order to provide completely separate accommodation for women. This section is now known as D Division. Pentridge remained the main female prison until it was replaced by the new women's prison, HM Prison Fairlea in 1956. Pentridge was also the location of reformatories for both girls and boys, established following the findings of the Stawell Royal Commission of 1870. The Jika Reformatory for Boys was accommodated in an existing building (F Division), between 1875 and 1879, while a purpose built reformatory was constructed for the Jika Reformatory for Protestant Girls (G Division), which operated between 1875 and 1893. In 1900 labour yards for A Division were completed. During the 1950s these yards were later converted to a high security block which became known as H Division. In 1924 Pentridge replaced the Melbourne Gaol as the main remand and reception prison for the metropolitan area. The bodies of a number of prisoners executed at the Melbourne Gaol were exhumed and relocated to Pentridge, where they were reburied, possibly just east of D Division. Pentridge also became the venue for all subsequent hangings, until the last Victorian prisoner to suffer the death penalty, Ronald Ryan was executed in D Division in 1967. In April 1995 the Office of Corrections ordered that the six main towers at Pentridge be closed, since most of the high security prisoners from the gaol had been relocated to Barwon as part of the downgrading of Pentridge to a medium security prison. The prison was finally closed in 1996.",vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/306,Coburg,"['Moreland City', 'Coburg', 'Tourist', 'Historic Site']"

Monument,Melbourne City,Shrine Of Rememberance,144.9734889,-37.830544399999994," It commemorates the service and sacrifice of all Victorians who have served and died in wars since World War I (1914-18). It embodies the devastating impact of that war on the Australian nation, and Victoria in particular, which lost the largest proportion of its young men in the country. When the project was conceived, Melbourne was the capital of Australia and the seat of Federal Parliament and this resulted in the grandest war memorial in Australia, until the Australian War Memorial was built in Canberra in 1941. Since World War II (1939-45) numerous elements, including a commemorative forecourt, trees, statues and memorials, have been added to the Shrine Reserve to honour servicemen and women and peacekeepers from 1939 to the present day. As the largest and most important war memorial in Victoria, it reflects the community's ongoing need for a public expression of grief and of commemoration for the sacrifice of life in war.",vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/806,Melbourne City,"['Melbourne City', 'Melbourne City', 'Tourist', 'Monument']"
